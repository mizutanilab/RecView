## RecView <A href="https://scicrunch.org/scicrunch/Resources/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_016531/resolver">RRID:SCR_016531</A>
RecView is a program for tomographic reconstruction and image processing. It consists of over 25,000 lines of custom source codes in C++, CUDA C, OpenCL, and x86/x86_64 (x64) assembly languages including SIMD instructions up to AVX2. RecView is designed for processing data obtained at the BL20B2, BL20XU, BL37XU, and BL47XU beamlines of the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility and also those taken at the 32-ID beamline of Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory.

Three-dimensional structural analysis with microtomography (micro-CT) or nanotomography (nano-CT) is performed by recording two-dimensional x-ray images while rotating the sample. Then tomographic sections are calculated from the x-ray images with the convolution back-projection method. This calculation is repeated for each tomographic slice to reconstruct the entire three-dimensional structure. RecView is a program for the tomographic reconstruction calculation with graphical user interfaces. Multiple datasets can be continuously processed by using its queueing function. Zooming reconstruction (an example is shown left), Gaussian convolution for denoising, and many other procedures for image processing are also implemented. Resolution of real sample images can be estimated with the Fourier domain plot by using this program.

## Release notes
The binary folder contains 64-bit (x64) and 32-bit (x86) executables complied using Visual Studio 2017 C++ and CUDA Toolkit 10.0. If your PC is running 64-bit Windows and has an NVIDIA Tesla, GeForce, or Quadro GPU processor with 'compute capability' of 3.0 or higher (Kepler or later), the reonstruction calculation can be executed on the GPU. <br>
The present version can also be compiled with Visual Studio 2008 and CUDA Toolkit 5.5 by using gazoVS2008.sln file. An x64CUDA executable built with VS2008 is available from the binary folder. This exe can run on GPUs with 'compute capability' of 2.0 (Fermi). A CUDA executable for x86 platform can be built with VS2008.  

A test dataset in TIFF format is available from the binary folder.

    <LI>Tau (Core i5-4670 (x64), 4 threads, 3.4 GHz) = 0.38 nsec (2.9 sec for a 2048x2048 tomogram from 1800 projections)
    </UL>
  <LI>Build-190111. On-the-fly reconstruction with which you can adjust the rotation axis in real time was implemented. If your PC has a sufficient computing power (over 1500 cores of GPU or 8 cores of AVX2-compatible CPU preferably Skylake or later), the axis position can be adjusted in real time using mouse wheel + shift key. Procedures for the data transfer between CPU and GPU were revised to accelerate the calculation.

  <LI>v5.4.1 (27 Jan 2018). Image analysis routines were updated. No revision were made in the offset CT kernel. Errors observed for some offset-CT data taken at SPring-8 were due to the 'conv.bat' files. Its workaround is described in the FAQ section below. Executable of this release is available only for x64 platforms because this is a very minor revision. 
  <LI>v5.4.0 (3 May 2017). Image analysis routines were updated. The offset CT routine is now under revision.

## Frequently asked questions
<OL>
  <LI><b>System requirements</b></LI>
    RecView can be executed on a Windows PC running Windows 7-10 with an x86 or x64 CPU and a local storage. Its reoncstruction kernel can run either on CPU or GPU. The CUDA kernel can be executed on NVIDIA GPU processors with 'compute capability' 3.0 or higher (this corresponds to Kepler processors or later). If you run RecView on a legacy CPU without using GPU, we recommend CPUs released after approx 2005 (i.e., Pentium4 / Athlon64 or later), because SSE2 SIMD instructions are used in the x86/x64 reconstruction kernel. This is not a requirement, but the performance may differ by a factor of 2-3 with or without the SIMD. The x86/x64 kernel also uses AVX2 instructions if available. <br><br>

  <LI><b>What kind of data can be processed?</b></LI>
    RecView is designed for the reconstruction of tomographic data obtained at SPring-8 and APS. However, any kind of data can be processed. Please contact the author if you have problems in using this program with your own data. Dataset requirements are:
    <UL>
      <LI>We use file names beginning with alphabet characters followed by sequential frame number, such as 'q0005.tif' for frame #5.</LI>
      <LI>Place a dark-field image 'dark.tif' in the dataset folder.</LI>
      <LI>Prepare a paprameter file 'output.log' in plain text format (an example is given in the test dataset). This file has four fields:<BR>

          Spreadsheet softwares work well for manually generating this 'output.log' file. The 'time' fields are used for interpolating the trend of flatfield pixel intensities. <BR>The output.log files of some SPring-8 sessions list angle in pulses instead of angle in degrees. RecView can recognize both formats.
      </LI>
    </UL><br>
  <LI><b>RecView returns an error when processing offset-CT data taken at SPring-8.</b></LI>
    In the offset CT, the sample is rotated by 360 degrees. Start and stop angles of the sample rotation vary depending on your setup, such as -180 to 180 deg or 0 to 360 deg. If the 'stop angle' was not exactly 360 deg in your offset-CT experiment, 'conv.bat' file seems to have incorrect contents. You have to edit it manually before the reconstruction calculation. Or you can find examples of conv.bat and output.log files in the 'docs' folder. <br><br>
  <LI><b>How to try the test dataset.</b></LI>
    <UL>
      <LI>Extract all files in the archived test dataset.</LI>
      <LI>Open one of TIFF files (such as Q0005.tif) using RecView.</LI>
      <LI>Open 'Tomography'-'Reconstruction...' dialog.</LI>

      <LI>Click 'Show image' button. In seconds, a cross section of an aluminum wire with a square-wave pattern carved on its surface will be shown.</LI>
    </UL><br>
  <LI><b>Does RecView make network connections?</b></LI>
      No, never. However, remote folders such as workgroup PCs are searched when you open files. It's probably one of default functions of Windows depending on your environment.<br><br>

  <LI><b>How to prepare a development environment for RecView.</b></LI>
      You need Visual Studio 2017 and CUDA Toolkit 10.0 to compile the source code. The 'Desktop Environment with C++' package and 'Visual C++ MFC' component of VS2017 should be installed. You may also need to update GPU driver to the latest one to run the CUDA reconstruction kernel. 
      <UL>
        <LI>Install 'Visual Studio Comunity 2017' from the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community">Microsoft site</a>. Choose 'Desktop Development with C++' and include the 'Visual C++ MFC' component. We recommend to include language packs of English(US) and Japanese. </LI>
        <LI>Download 'CUDA Toolkit 10.0' from the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive">NVIDIA Toolkit site</a> and istall. The installation will associate the toolkit with Visual Studio.</LI>
        <LI>If your local PC has NVIDIA GPU, download the latest GPU driver from the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.jp/Download/index.aspx">NVIDIA driver site</a> and install. It is not recommended to update the driver using Device Manager of Windows Control Panel.</LI>
        <LI>Open Visual Studio solution file 'gazo.sln'. Choose your platform (x64 or Win32) and build configuration (Release or CUDA_Release) from the toolbar and generate executable from the 'Build' menu. You can find an .exe file under the 'x64' or 'Win32' folder. The recent CUDA Toolkit seems not compatible with the Win32 (x86) platform.</LI>
        <LI>Another configuration 'CUDAFFT_Release' is also provided in the solution file. In this configuration, Fourier transform calculations in the deconvolution step can be executed on the GPU, though its elapsed time is comparable to that of the x86/x64 CPU. Dynamic link libraries ('cudart64_100.dll' and 'cufft64_100.dll') must be placed in the folder where the CUDAFFT executable is placed. The library files are available as part of the CUDA Toolkit.</LI>
